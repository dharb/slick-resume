# HTML Resume Template

I was tired of using PDF tools to create a resume as a web developer, so I created this HTML version. It's built to be sleek and small (~11kB). See it in action at [davidharbage.com](https://davidharbage.com). Others may feel free to use it as a template for their own resume.
